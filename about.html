            <p>Welcome to my personal space on the web, a digital canvas where I share the worlds I capture through my
                lens and the visions I bring to life with my illustrations. My name is
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michal-gaworski/">Michał Gaworski</a>, and I'm a
                Kraków-based software engineer by profession and a passionate photographer and illustrator by heart.</p>
            <img class="pic pic-right" src="/imgs/work.jpg"/>
            <p>Born and raised in the historic city of Kraków, Poland, my journey into the realms of technology and art
                started at a young age. As a software engineer, I've spent years honing my skills in designing and
                building complex systems, weaving the fabric of our digital future. But beyond the code, I've always
                been
                captivated by the beauty of our world and the stories waiting to be told through visual mediums.</p>
            <p>Photography for me is not just a hobby; it's a way of seeing, understanding, and interpreting the world
                around us. Whether it's the serene landscapes of the Polish countryside, the vibrant streets of Kraków,
                or the
                intimate moments of everyday life, my camera is my tool for exploration and storytelling.</p>
            <p>Illustration, on the other hand, allows me to venture beyond the confines of reality, into realms of
                imagination and creativity. From whimsical characters to intricate landscapes, my illustrations are a
                reflection of
                my inner world, brought to life through colors, lines, and textures.</p>
            <p>This website is my personal gallery, a place where I share both the captured and the created. Each
                photograph and illustration you'll find here is a piece of my journey, an expression of my passion for
                art and technology, and a testament to the beauty that surrounds us and the stories we tell.</p>
            <p>Thank you for visiting.</p>
